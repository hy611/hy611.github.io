Hello! I am Yang Hu, currently working as a Sr. Battery Cell Engineer at Rivian Automotive, LLC. I received my PhD degree in Department of Mechanical Engineering from Auburn University in May 2021, supervised by Dr. Song-Yul Choe. My experties include (1) Modeling and simulation for lithium-ion cells (equivalent circuit/electrochemical/degradation/thermal); (2) model-based design and development (DC fast charge/regenerative charge); (3) Model-based control and state estimation (SOC/SOH); (4) Experimentla characterization (degradation/heat generation rate/heat source terms).
